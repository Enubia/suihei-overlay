# suihei-overlay

Suihei overlay is a full responsive ACT overlay for FFXIV. You can either use it in a horizontal style or shrink it down and use it in a table like format. (Pictures will follow)

It is heavily inspired by [Horizoverlay](https://github.com/bsides/horizoverlay) and [Kagerou](https://github.com/hibiyasleep/kagerou).

Although right now it only provides bare minimum functionality, I plan to add more and more features as time goes on.

### Roadmap
